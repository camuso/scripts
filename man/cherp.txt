Invoking cherp with no commands presents the cherp menu.

This script will cherry-pick commits from a git branch into the current
branch.

Commits may be presented one at a time or in a "Source commits file",
containing upstream commits, with the earliest commit to be cherry-
picked being the first in the file. This file can be created with the
following git command.

git log <starting-commit> --oneline --no-merges --reverse > filename

You can edit the resulting file to put a leading # on the upstream
commits that you want to skip over.

Commit logs are automatically generated.

The user can type control-c at anytime to exit the script, and a best
effort will be made to assure the user's tree is left in a coherent
state.

All Environmental variables and options are sticky across invocations
of this script by use of a project file in which to store their most
recent state.

Terminology:

	Cherry-picked commits are those you are attempting to backport
	using git cherry-pick. Among the advantages of git cherry-pick
	is the clear identification of conflicts in files using the
	multiple chevron delimiters <<<<<< and >>>>>>.

	Backported commits are those you have committed to the current
	git branch after having applied cherry-picked commits from the
	upstream branch. Backported commits are used to generate the
	backport patch set.

Session Capture:

	To capture all input and output from this session, quit now and
	restart with the following command.

		cherp script.sh 3>&2>&1 | tee cherp.log

	You can also use "script" to capture your session. This will
	capture all activity, including activity in spawned shells.

		script -c cherp cherp.log

	To enjoy enhanced input editing capabilities, use \"rlwrap\".

		rlwrap cherp
