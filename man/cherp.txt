cherp
=======================================================================

Type 'q' at any time to exit this help.

cherp is a backporting tool that can use either git cherry-pick or
patch --merge. These are presented as options when cherp is started
for the very first time. They are also available as options from the
upper-case O item in the main menu.

When invoked without arguments, cherp will present a text mode menu.

This tool can be run in text menu mode or from the command line with
the commands listed below. In command line mode, it can be used to
backport single commits at a time or automate backporting from a list
of upstream commits created with the mkbackportlog tool in this suite.

abort     - abort the current backport
branch    - select a different downstream git branch
commit [1]- commit changes after conflict resolution and create commit log
            The optional '1' will return to the command line after the
            commit, otherwise the cherp menu will be presented.
help      - display this help
history   - show commits so far this session
new       - start a new session
nit       - select the hunks you wish to backport from the upstream commit
            Available in cherry-pick mode only
pick <h>  - backport one hash specified by <h>
reset     - choose from a list of commits to reset to
run       - run the backport automation
select    - select the next upstream has to backport from a list
setup     - run the cherp menu to setup the runtime environment
            This is easier and simpler than having a different command
            for every parameter.
status    - show the cherp session status and git status
version   - show this version of the cherp tool

Invoking cherp with no commands presents the cherp menu.

Enter one of the above:

This tool will backport commits from a branch in a remote upstream
repo into into a branch in the downstream repo.
The downstream repo is the [origin] repo and the upstream repo is
input by the user. The default is ...
//git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

Commits may be entered one at a time or from a Backport Commits file"
most easily created using the mkbackportlog tool in this suite.

You can edit the resulting file to put a leading # on the upstream
commits that you want to skip over.

Commit logs are automatically generated.

The user can type control-c at anytime to exit the tool, and a best
effort will be made to assure the user's tree is left in a coherent
state.

All Environmental variables and options are sticky across invocations
of this tool.
