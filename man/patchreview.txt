===================
Patchreview v12.0
===================

This menu-driven script allows the user to compare a set of patches
from one branch with those of another branch. The branches can be
remote or local.

The script was designed to be used for comparing RHEL patches with the
correspoinding upstream commits from which they were derived or backported.
The comparison helps identify differences between the two, giving the
reviewer a clear picture of how close the backported RHEL patches are to
the upstream commits.

---------------
1. Installation
---------------

The patchreview script and its dependencies can be git-cloned into any
directory, however that directory must be in your executable path.

For example:

	$ cd $HOME
	$ git -c http.sslVerify=false \
	  clone https://tosmith@gitlab.cee.redhat.com/tcamuso/patchtools.git \
	  mybin
	$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mybin

If you are contributing to the development of the script, send email
to tcamuso@redhat.com for 'git push' access credentials.

After the above sequence of commands, the user can invoke patchreview
from the command line in any directory that contains a valid git repo.

--------------------------------
2. Preparing the Git Environment
--------------------------------

The script must be run from the top of a linux git tree. If not, it will
exit with an error message.

Your repo directory should be configured with gitlab RHEL or CentOS tree
as origin/main. Each RHEL/CentOS distro should have its own directory.
Be sure to add your fork to that directory.

For example.

	### Create the RHEL-8 repo
	$ mkdir -p /work/rhel8
	$ cd /work/rhel8
	$ git clone git@gitlab.com:redhat/rhel/src/kernel/rhel-8.git \
	     kernel
	$ cd kernel
	$ git remote add tcamuso git@gitlab.com:tcamuso/rhel-8.git
	$ git fetch --all

	### Create the centos-9 repo
	$ mkdir -p /work/c9s
	$ git clone \
	  git@gitlab.com:redhat/centos-stream/src/kernel/centos-stream-9.git \
	  kernel
	$ cd kernel
	$ git remote add tcamuso git@gitlab.com:tcamuso/centos-stream-9.git
	$ git fetch --all

The linus tree should be located in a different directory
	$ mkdir -p /work/upstream
	$ cd /work/upstream
	$ git clone \
	      git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git \
	      kernel
	$ cd kernel
	$ git fetch --all

Other upstream repos can be added to the upstream kernel tree as needed.
For example...
	$ cd /work/upstream/kernel
	$ git remote add scsi \
	  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi.git
	$ git remote add net-next \
	  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net-next.git
	$ git fetch --all -p

The directory tree created by the above operations would look like this.

 work --+-- rhel8 --- kernel     ## contains RHEL8 kernel and your fork
        |
        +-- c9s  --- kernel      ## contains centos-9 kernel and your folrk
        |
        +-- upstream --- kernel  ## contains linus tree and any other trees
                                 ## you added with 'git remote add'

Run this program from one of the downstream directories, e.g.
/work/rhel8/kernel.

Create a file of the repo list in $HOME/.config/patchreview/repolist.
This file is used by patchreview to navigate among the various repos.
For example, within patchreview you can switch from the rhel8 repo to
the c9s repo by pressing upper case 'W' at the main menu and selecting
from the list presented. The list is from ~/.config/patchreview/repolist.

$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir -p .config/patchreview
$ > .config/patchreview/repolist
$ echo '/work/rhel8/kernel' >> .config/patchreview/repolist
$ echo '/work/c9s/kernel' >> .config/patchreview/repolist

At this point, the directory environment is ready.

---------------------------------------
3. Runing the script for the First Time
---------------------------------------

When invoking the script for the first time, or in a new git tree, the
script queries the user for the following items.

* The Patch directory

* The Work directory

* The user's preferred diff editor.
  vimdiff, emacs, and tkdiff are supported.

Detailed descriptions of these items follow.

Patch directory: is the directory containing the backported patches.

		 If this directory were populated by a mail client, then
		 the files must be renamed to be processed. The files
		 will be renamed according to their subject lines with
		 non-alpha-numeric characters replaced with hyphens.

		 This will occur automatically upon pressing the 'r'
		 control option, but only if there are no *.patch files
		 in the directory.

		 Alternatively, the user can invoke the 'R' control to
		 separately rename the files without having to run the
		 whole script.

Work directory: is the directory into which the script will put upstream
                patches that were formatted using the upstream commit
                hashes in the commit logs of the patches in the Patch
                directory.

		Log files generated by the script will also be put in
		this directory.

		This will occur automatically upon pressing the 'r'
		control otion, but only if there are no *.patch files
		in the directory.

		Alternatively, the user can invoke the 'F control to
		separately create the upstream patches without having to
		run the whole script.

The first two items in the "Environment" section reflect the current
state of the git tree.

   - most recent tag in the current git branch.
   - current head of the current git branch.

Fig 1. Main Menu

-------------------------------------
4.1 Main Menu selections (See Fig. 1)
-------------------------------------

Some menu items are sticky and retain their values between invocations of
the script. Sticky items will be indicated with a * in the help text below.
These are saved in a patchreview.conf file in the .data/ directory in your
current repo directory. If .data/ does not exist, it will be created by
the script. patchreview.conf is a text file and can be edited or deleted.
If it's deleted, you will be prompted for initial values as you were the
first time the script was invoked.

4.1.1 Environment Section
-------------------------

This section of the menu sets up the operating environment for the
patchreview script with the following selections.

c * Invokes the config menu. These are preferences that will be preserved
    between invocations of patchreview.
    The configuration menu has its own help text.

b * sets the git branch from which you will be operating. When selecting
    this option, you will be presented with a numbered list of branches
    currently in your RHEL repo directory from which to choose.

W * Presents a numbered list of RHEL repos that are available for the user
    work in. This list was created by the user in the file ...
    $HOME/.config/patchreview/repolist
    ... as instructed above.
    This allows you to move from one RHEL directory to another without
    having to exit the script.

d * Change the directory to receive the RHEL patches

w * (lower case w) Change the directory to receive upstream patches
    and script logs.

u * (upper case W) Change the directory and branch of the upstream repo.

g * prompts the user for a string to grep for in the merge list.

-------------------------------------
4.1.2 main controls
-------------------------------------

M - enter a specific merge request to review

m - show the list of merge requests obtained by the 'r' menu entry.
    If the list does not exist, the user will be presented with a
    menu to select the contents of the merge request list.

r - Refresh the Merge Request list. The user will be presented with
    a menu from which to select the criteria for the MR list.

a - Ack/Nack or Comment on the current Merge Request

i - Initializes the script to the defaults as currently stored in
    patchreview.conf.

q - quit the script and return to the shell

x - Toggle the presence of the Discrete Operations Menu. The menu
    entries remain active whether or not the extended menu is visible.

-----------------------------------------
4.1.3 Discrete Operations Menu (See Fig. 1)
-----------------------------------------

F - Format upstream patches into the Work directory using commit hashes
    discovered in the commit logs of the *.patch files in the Patch
    directory. This will not alter the contents of the Work directory
    if there are any *.patch files in it.
    Files downloaded from email must be renamed with the R control first.

S - Seek fixes that may be missing from the serires.
    Files downloaded from email must be renamed with the R control first.

P - Run the patch comparison to compare the submitted patches in the
    Patch directory with the formatted upstream patches in the Work
    directory according to the patch comparison mode.
    Upstream patches must be derived from the hashes in the patches
    in the Patch dirictory with F control first.

A - Apply the patch or patch series. This option only appears if there
    are patches remaining to be applied and the patch apply mode is
    not OFF.

B - Create a new branch at the current git head. This can be useful
    when expecting patches that depend on the currently applied ones.
    You will be presented with an option to tag the branch.

C - Presents a submenu giving the user the choice to delete either or
    both the Patch and Work directories. The user can also return from
    the submenu without choosing any of the options.

G - git reset head of the current branc to it's most recent tag.

N - Clears the *.patch files out of the Patch and Wokr directories and
    resets the branch head to the most recent tag.

V - View the session log files. This will present a menu of the currently
    existing log files you can view. The 'less' app is utilized for this
    function, so all the 'less' navigation controls apply.

-------------------------------------
4.2 Typical operation
-------------------------------------

You will use either M to enter a specific Merge Request, or m to see
a list of merge requests that was created using the criteria you cite
when queried by the MR list manager.

You will see the following prompts appear after you enter the MR.
User input is enclosed in angle brackets, for the sakd of illustration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter a Merge Request or press ENTER to keep 3769 : <3798>
Getting comments from MR 3798
Continue with review? y/n: <y>
There are already RHEL patch files in /work/8/kernel/.patches.
Do you want to replace them?  (y/n) : <y>
Getting patches from MR 3798
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, the script does the following.
   . Retrieve the MR from GitLab
   . Extract the RHEL patches from the MR
   . Create the Upstream patches for comparison using the upstream
     commit listed in each RHEL patch.
   . Look upstream for fixes that are not in the RHEL series and that
     have not been merged into the RHEL repo. Missing fixes will be
     saved in a log file in the Work directory.
   . Automatically compare the files.
   . Present the user with a "No Conflicts" message or a list of
     conflicts detected.

This menu is presented after the the patches have been compared in batch
mode by the script. If there are no conflicting patches, you will see the
following message ...

 *********************************************
 *                                           *
 *     There are no conflicting patches      *
 *                                           *
 *********************************************

... and the menu will appear as follows.

    With : ../cmp/0001-selftests-netfilter-missing-error-check-when-setting.patch

	    Last Tag : kernel-4.18.0-228.el8
	    RHEL dir : /home/tcamuso/Maildir/work/cur
	Upstream dir : ../cmp
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	c - run batch file comparison to find conflicts with upstream
	b - back to the previous patch
	n - prompt for a number for a specific patch
	p - replace current upstream patch with a different commit
	x - spawns a secondary shell
	q - quit and return to previous execution environment
	or any other key moves forward to the next patch ... q
_________________________________________________________________________
Fig 5. Interactively Compare Patches menu when there are no conflicts

At this point, the most sensible thing is to press 'q', but you can look at
the patches if you like. Pressing any key other than the ones with specific
actions will invoke the diff editor you chose when you first invoked this
script.

If conflicts were discovered, you will be presented with the enumeration of
each patch having conflicts and the total number of conflicts.

   Enter one of the above:

If you ack or nack the MR, you will see that it has been ACKed or NACKed
in this menu and in the main menu. This flag is cleared when you enter
another MR for review.

---------------------
5. External App Menus
---------------------

There are two external (not sourced) scripts that can provide a menu to
the user. These scripts are included in the git repo for this script.

These menus compare the patches in the Patch directory with those in
the Work directory.

_________________________________________________________________________
Fig 7. Batch Comparison Setup Menu

  Each patchfile in the RHEL directory is compared with its complement in
  the Upstream directory. If a mismatched line is found, the sequence
  number of that patch pair is printed to the ofile, which is /dev/stdout
  by default.

  Verbose output options are available for examination of the files that
  are congruent and the ones that differ.

  Menu choices
  ------------

  All menu items are sticky, persisting across invocations of this script.
  You can use the verbose options to test the results.

  When you get the results you want, press q to advance to the Interactive
  comparison menu, where you can examine the patch pairs that were not
  congruent, if any.

  R - change the directory containing the RHEL patch files
  U - change the directory containing the Upstream patch files

  o - change the output file.
      The default is /dev/stdout, but the patchreview and patcmp scripts
      will call this with an output file defined that will exist in the
      Upstream patch directory as mm.log. You may change the name and
      location of this file with this option.

  d - when true, excludes diff stat lines from the comparison.
      It is possible for the patches to still be congruent even when
      the diff stats are different. For example, when the RHEL patch is
      a subset of the upstream patch
      Default: true

  p - when true, excludes path lines from the comparison
      You will want to do this if the file being patched has been renamed
      or moved to a different directory.
      Default: true

  s - when true, excludes lines that do not begin with + or -
      You will want to do this if you are only concerned about the lines
      that are actually being changed by the patch. When true, this will
      automatically exclude the diff stat lines, but WILL NOT exclude
      the path lines.
      Default: true

  v - verbose prints the sequence numbers of all files and indicates which
      are congruent and which are not
      Default: false

  V - Very verbose prints the sequence numbers of all the files, all the
      lines being compared in each file, and indicates whether the files
      are congruent or not.
      Default: false

      If Very verbose is true, then verbose will automatically be set true.
      If verbose is false, then Very verbose will automatically be set false.

  r - run the comparison
  e - run less on the output file
  i - init the controls and output file to defaults
  h - less this help text
  x - spawn a shell
  q - quit and return to previous execution environment
