===================
Patchreview v10.3.2
===================

This menu-driven script allows the user to compare a set of patches
from one branch with those of another branch. The branches can be
remote or local.

The script was designed to be used for comparing RHEL patches with the
correspoinding upstream commits from which they were derived or backported.
The comparison helps identify differences between the two, giving the
reviewer a clear picture of how close the backported RHEL patches are to
the upstream commits.

---------------
1. Installation
---------------

The patchreview script and its dependencies can be git-cloned into any
directory, however that directory must be in your executable path.

For example:

	$ cd $HOME
	$ git clone https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/tcamuso/patchtools mybin
	$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/mybin

After the above sequence of commands, the user can invoke patchreview
from the command line.

--------------------------------
2. Preparing the Git Environment
--------------------------------

The script must be run from the top of a linux git tree. If not, it will
exit with an error message.

Your repo directory should be configured with gitlab RHEL or CentOS tree
as origin/main.

The linus tree should be added as a remote, i.e:
	$ git remote add linus \
	  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

Add other remote branches as needed.

At this point, the git environment is ready to compare RHEL patches with
their upstream counterparts.

---------------------------------------
3. Runing the script for the First Time
---------------------------------------

When invoking the script for the first time, or in a new git tree, the
script queries the user for the following items.

* Whether your terminal background color is light or dark

* The Patch directory

* The Work directory

* The user's preferred diff editor.
  vimdiff, emacs, and tkdiff are supported.

Detailed descriptions of these items follow.


Background color: is used to determine the correct color scheme.

Patch directory: is the directory containing the backported patches.

		 If this directory were populated by a mail client, then
		 the files must be renamed to be processed. The files
		 will be renamed according to their subject lines with
		 non-alpha-numeric characters replaced with hyphens.

		 This will occur automatically upon pressing the 'r'
		 control option, but only if there are no *.patch files
		 in the directory.

		 Alternatively, the user can invoke the 'R' control to
		 separately rename the files without having to run the
		 whole script.

Work directory: is the directory into which the script will put upstream
                patches that were formatted using the upstream commit
                hashes in the commit logs of the patches in the Patch
                directory.

		This will occur automatically upon pressing the 'r'
		control otion, but only if there are no *.patch files
		in the directory.

		Alternatively, the user can invoke the 'F control to
		separately create the upstream patches without having to
		run the whole script.

The first two items in the "Environment" section reflect the current
state of the git tree.

   - most recent tag in the current git branch.
   - current head of the current git branch.

Fig 2. Configuration Menu

	o - Operating mode, selects between Merge Request and email modes.
	    Merge Request is the default.

	c - Presents the comments for the Merge request before downloading
	    the MR patches and comparing them with upstream.

	d - Patch directory will receive the RHEL patches.

	w - Work directory will receive the corresponding upstream patches
	    and the script log files.

	s - Selects the remote branch to search for missing fixes.
	    Fixes are defined in the upsteam patch submission rules as
	    follows.
	    If your patch fixes a bug in a specific commit, e.g. you found
	    an issue using git bisect, please use the ‘Fixes:’ tag with the
	    first 12 characters of the SHA-1 ID, and the one line summary.
	    For example:
	    Fixes: e21d2170f366 ("video: remove unnecessary platform_set_drvdata()"$OFF

	    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html

	e - Presents a menu from which to select one of the three supported
	    diff editors.
	f - Because there can be some differences in the way developers copy
	    the upstream summary line, fuzz is sometimes necessary to minimize
	    false positives of invalid commits.
	    This item will present a menu of available fuzz levels.
	    The default is 'case insensitive and ignore all punctuation'

	p - This selection will cycle the patch compare mode through its
	    different states.
	    The default is Batch, and, unless you're familiar with the
	    Patch Compare Manager, it's probably best to just leave it.

b * Sets the git branch from which you will be operating. It is assumed
    that you have at least one RHEL branch and one upstream branch in
    your git directory. When selecting this option, you will be
    presented with a numbered choice as follows.

4.2 Discrete Operations Menu (See Fig. 1)
-----------------------------------------

F - Format upstream patches into the Work directory using commit hashes
    discovered in the commit logs of the *.patch files in the Patch
    directory. This will not alter the contents of the Work directory
    if there are any *.patch files in it.
    Files downloaded from email must be renamed with the R control first.

S - Seek fixes that may be missing from the serires.
    Files downloaded from email must be renamed with the R control first.

P - Run the patch comparison to compare the submitted patches in the
    Patch directory with the formatted upstream patches in the Work
    directory according to the patch comparison mode.
    Upstream patches must be derived from the hashes in the patches
    in the Patch dirictory with F control first.

A - Apply the patch or patch series. This option only appears if there
    are patches remaining to be applied and the patch apply mode is
    not OFF.

B - Create a new branch at the current git head. This can be useful
    when expecting patches that depend on the currently applied ones.
    You will be presented with an option to tag the branch.

C - Presents a submenu giving the user the choice to delete either or
    both the Patch and Work directories. The user can also return from
    the submenu without choosing any of the options.

G - git reset head of the current branc to it's most recent tag.

N - Clears the *.patch files out of the Patch and Wokr directories and
    resets the branch head to the most recent tag.

V - View the session log files. This will present a menu of the currently
    existing log files you can view. The 'less' app is utilized for this
    function, so all the 'less' navigation controls apply.


After the Merge Request commits have been compared with their upstream
counterparts, you will be presented with the option to Ack or Nack the
Merge Request.

 For MR 379, you want to ...
 a  ACK
 A  ACK with comment
 n  NACK
 N  NACK with comment
 q  Skip this step

Enter a, n, or q: q

---------------------
5. External App Menus
---------------------

There are two external (not sourced) scripts that can provide a menu to
the user. These scripts are included in the git repo for this script.

These menus compare the patches in the Patch directory with those in
the Work directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 The Interactively Compare patches with upstream commits menu
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This menu is presented after the the patches have been compared in batch
mode by the script. If there are no conflicting patches, you will see the
following message ...

 *********************************************
 *                                           *
 *     There are no conflicting patches      *
 *                                           *
 *********************************************

... and the menu will appear as follows.

_________________________________________________________________________
Fig 5. Interactively Compare Patches menu when there are no conflicts

At this point, the most sensible thing is to press 'q', but you can look at
the patches if you like. Pressing any key other than the ones with specific
actions will invoke the diff editor you chose when you first invoked this
script.

If conflicts were discovered, you will be presented with the enumeration of
each patch having conflicts and the total number of conflicts.

_________________________________________________________________________
Fig. 6 Interactively Compare Patches menu when there are conflicts

The header of the menu not only contains the patch files being compared,
but also the count of the conflict against the total, as "1 of 14".

Pressing any key other than the ones mapped to specific actions will
invoke your diff editor to view the conflicting RHEL vs. upstream
patches.

Exiting the editor returns to the "Interactively Compare patches" menu,
where you will see the conflict count bumped to "2 of 14".

Only conflicting patches will be presented, unless you press 'n' to view
a specific patch outside of the conflicted ones.

c - invokes the batch comparison script to generate a list of files that
    are sufficiently different to warrant human inspection. When this
    key is pressed, the Batch Comparison menu is presented.

m - Option only appears if conflicting patches were detected by the batch
    comparison script.
    This opton is set to true by default after running a batch
    comparison. When true, only the conflicting patches will be
    diffed by the editor. When this option is true, all patches are
    considered.
    You can view non-conflicting patches by pressing 'n' to provide the
    patch number.

s - Option only appears if a list of incongruent patch pairs was
    generated by the batch comparison script.
    When the associated key is pressed, a list of numbers of the patch
    pairs that were incongruent is printed to the screen.

b - Steps back to the previously examined patch.

n - Prompts for a patch number to examine. This can be any patch pair
    in the set.

p - Prompts for a different commit hash for the most recently examined
    patch.

x - Spawns a secondary cell. Press control-d or type "exit" to return.

q - Quits and returns to the caller.

Any other key advances the patch counter to present the next RHEL/upstream
pair of patches to examine.

_________________________________________________________________________
Fig 7. Batch Comparison Setup Menu

  Each patchfile in the RHEL directory is compared with its complement in
  the Upstream directory. If a mismatched line is found, the sequence
  number of that patch pair is printed to the ofile, which is /dev/stdout
  by default.

  Verbose output options are available for examination of the files that
  are congruent and the ones that differ.

  Menu choices
  ------------

  All menu items are sticky, persisting across invocations of this script.
  You can use the verbose options to test the results.

  When you get the results you want, press q to advance to the Interactive
  comparison menu, where you can examine the patch pairs that were not
  congruent, if any.

  R - change the directory containing the RHEL patch files
  U - change the directory containing the Upstream patch files

  o - change the output file.
      The default is /dev/stdout, but the patchreview and patcmp scripts
      will call this with an output file defined that will exist in the
      Upstream patch directory as mm.log. You may change the name and
      location of this file with this option.

  d - when true, excludes diff stat lines from the comparison.
      It is possible for the patches to still be congruent even when
      the diff stats are different. For example, when the RHEL patch is
      a subset of the upstream patch
      Default: true

  p - when true, excludes path lines from the comparison
      You will want to do this if the file being patched has been renamed
      or moved to a different directory.
      Default: true

  s - when true, excludes lines that do not begin with + or -
      You will want to do this if you are only concerned about the lines
      that are actually being changed by the patch. When true, this will
      automatically exclude the diff stat lines, but WILL NOT exclude
      the path lines.
      Default: true

  v - verbose prints the sequence numbers of all files and indicates which
      are congruent and which are not
      Default: false

  V - Very verbose prints the sequence numbers of all the files, all the
      lines being compared in each file, and indicates whether the files
      are congruent or not.
      Default: false

      If Very verbose is true, then verbose will automatically be set true.
      If verbose is false, then Very verbose will automatically be set false.

  r - run the comparison
  e - run less on the output file
  i - init the controls and output file to defaults
  h - less this help text
  x - spawn a shell
  q - quit and return to previous execution environment
