Configuration Menu

	o - Operating mode, selects between Merge Request and email modes.
	    Merge Request is the default.

	c - Presents the comments for the Merge request before downloading
	    the MR patches and comparing them with upstream.
	    This switch toggles this utility ON/OFF

	s - Toggles the 'Automatially Seek Fixes' mode ON/OFF
	    When ON, the script will search upstream for fixes that are not
	    included in the series being reviewed and not yet merged into
	    the downstream (RHEL) repo.

	d - Name the directory to receive the RHEL patches.

	w - Name the directory to receive the corresponding upstream patches
	    and the script log files.

	r - Selects the remote branch to search for missing fixes.
	    Fixes are defined in the upsteam patch submission rules as
	    follows.
	    If your patch fixes a bug in a specific commit, e.g. you found
	    an issue using git bisect, please use the ‘Fixes:’ tag with the
	    first 12 characters of the SHA-1 ID, and the one line summary.
	    For example:
	    Fixes: e21d2170f366 ("video: remove unnecessary platform_set_drvdata()"$OFF

	    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html

	e - Presents a menu from which to select one of the three supported
	    diff editors.
	     1 - vimdiff
 	     2 - emacs
 	     3 - tkdiff

	f - Because there can be some differences in the way developers copy
	    the upstream summary line, fuzz is sometimes necessary to minimize
	    false positives of invalid commits.
	    This item will present a menu of available fuzz levels.
	    The default is 'case insensitive and ignore all punctuation'

	p - This selection will cycle the patch compare mode through three
	    different states.
	    The default is Batch, and, unless you're familiar with the
	    Patch Compare Manager, it's probably best to just leave it.

	v - Toggle verbose mode ON/OFF

	C - Toggle screen background LIGHT/DARK
	    This is automatically sensed by the script when invoked, but
	    can be changed with this selection.

	h - Uses 'less' to print this menu to the screen.

	q - Return to Main Menu
