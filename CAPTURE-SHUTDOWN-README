# capture-shutdown and capture-boot - Preserve Shutdown Stack Traces Across Boots

## Overview

`capture-shutdown` and `capture-boot` are companion scripts to `bootstat` that capture kernel messages
and dmesg output during shutdown and immediately on boot. This allows `bootstat` to detect stack traces
that occurred during shutdown, which would otherwise be lost when the system reboots.

### Important Limitation

**BUG traces that occur during the kernel reboot sequence** (after "reboot: Restarting system" message)
**cannot be captured by user-space scripts** because they happen after systemd has killed all user-space
processes. To capture these traces, you need to use **console capture**:
- Serial console logging (if available)
- Video console capture (framebuffer capture)
- Kernel crash dumps (kdump, if configured)

The scripts will capture traces that occur *before* the kernel reboot sequence begins, but traces during
the actual reboot sequence require console capture mechanisms.

### Components

- **capture-shutdown**: Captures dmesg during shutdown (runs as a systemd service before shutdown.target)
- **capture-boot**: Captures dmesg immediately on boot before it's cleared (runs early in boot process)
- Both scripts save traces to `/var/log/shutdown-traces/` for analysis by `bootstat`

## Quick Installation

The easiest way to install both scripts and services is using the installation script:

```bash
sudo ./capture-install.sh
```

This will:
- Install scripts to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Install systemd service files to `/etc/systemd/system/`
- Create the log directory `/var/log/shutdown-traces/`
- Enable and start the services

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

### 1. Install Scripts

Copy scripts to `/usr/local/bin/` and make them executable:

```bash
sudo cp capture-shutdown capture-boot /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/capture-shutdown
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/capture-boot
```

### 2. Install Systemd Services

Copy service files to `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```bash
sudo cp capture-shutdown.service capture-boot.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

### 3. Create Log Directory

Create the directory for storing traces:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/shutdown-traces
sudo chmod 755 /var/log/shutdown-traces
```

### 4. Enable and Start Services

Reload systemd and enable the services:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable capture-shutdown.service
sudo systemctl enable capture-boot.service
sudo systemctl start capture-boot.service
```

## How It Works

### capture-shutdown

- Runs during shutdown (before `shutdown.target`) as a systemd service
- Captures:
  - Current dmesg output
  - Recent messages from `/proc/kmsg` (if available)
  - Recent kernel messages from journalctl (if available)
- Saves everything to `/var/log/shutdown-traces/shutdown-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- Automatically cleans up old traces, keeping only the most recent 10 (configurable)

### capture-boot

- Runs very early in boot (after `local-fs.target`, before `sysinit.target`)
- Captures dmesg immediately before it's cleared by the kernel
- Looks for traces with reboot context (near "reboot: Restarting" or "reboot: machine restart" messages)
- Saves traces to `/var/log/shutdown-traces/boot-capture-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`
- Only saves files if traces with reboot context are found

### Why Both?

Some kernel bugs occur during the reboot sequence itself, after systemd services have stopped.
In these cases:
- `capture-shutdown` runs too early and misses the trace
- `capture-boot` captures dmesg on the next boot before it's cleared, preserving traces from the previous shutdown

## Configuration

You can customize the script behavior:

### capture-shutdown Options

- **Log directory**: Use `-d` or `--dir` to specify a different directory
- **Max traces**: Use `-m` or `--max` to keep more/fewer old traces

Example:
```bash
capture-shutdown --dir /var/log/my-traces --max 20
```

### capture-boot

capture-boot runs automatically and doesn't accept command-line arguments. It only saves
traces if they have reboot context, to avoid cluttering the log directory.

## Integration with bootstat

`bootstat` automatically checks `/var/log/shutdown-traces/` for saved shutdown traces.
When you run `bootstat -v`, it will:
- Detect if there are traces in saved shutdown files
- Detect if there are traces in boot-capture files
- Show them in the verbose output
- Report shutdown errors even if the journal doesn't persist across boots

## Service Management

### Check Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status capture-shutdown.service
sudo systemctl status capture-boot.service
```

### View Service Logs

```bash
sudo journalctl -u capture-shutdown.service
sudo journalctl -u capture-boot.service
```

### View Captured Traces

```bash
ls -lh /var/log/shutdown-traces/
cat /var/log/shutdown-traces/shutdown-*.log
cat /var/log/shutdown-traces/boot-capture-*.log
```

## Manual Testing

You can test the scripts manually:

### Test capture-shutdown

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/capture-shutdown
ls -lh /var/log/shutdown-traces/
```

### Test capture-boot

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/capture-boot
ls -lh /var/log/shutdown-traces/
```

Note: capture-boot only saves files if it finds traces with reboot context.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall both scripts and services:

```bash
sudo ./capture-install.sh --uninstall
```

Or manually:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop capture-boot.service
sudo systemctl disable capture-shutdown.service capture-boot.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/capture-shutdown.service
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/capture-boot.service
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/capture-shutdown
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/capture-boot
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Note: The log directory `/var/log/shutdown-traces/` is not removed automatically.
To remove it manually: `sudo rm -rf /var/log/shutdown-traces`

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

If services fail to start:

1. Check service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status capture-shutdown.service
   sudo systemctl status capture-boot.service
   ```

2. Check service logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u capture-shutdown.service -n 50
   sudo journalctl -u capture-boot.service -n 50
   ```

3. Verify scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   ls -l /usr/local/bin/capture-shutdown
   ls -l /usr/local/bin/capture-boot
   ```

4. Test scripts manually:
   ```bash
   sudo /usr/local/bin/capture-shutdown
   sudo /usr/local/bin/capture-boot
   ```

### Traces Not Being Captured

- Verify the log directory exists and is writable:
  ```bash
  ls -ld /var/log/shutdown-traces
  ```

- Check if services are enabled:
  ```bash
  systemctl is-enabled capture-shutdown.service
  systemctl is-enabled capture-boot.service
  ```

- Check disk space:
  ```bash
  df -h /var/log
  ```

### capture-boot Not Finding Traces

capture-boot only saves files if it finds traces with reboot context. If you're not seeing
capture-boot log files, it means:
- No traces were found in dmesg, OR
- Traces were found but don't have reboot context (not near "reboot: Restarting" messages)

This is normal behavior - capture-boot is designed to only save relevant traces.

## Notes

- `capture-shutdown` runs during shutdown, so it has limited time (10 seconds timeout)
- `capture-boot` runs very early in boot, so it has limited time (5 seconds timeout)
- Both scripts capture dmesg which may be large - ensure `/var/log` has sufficient space
- Old traces are automatically cleaned up to prevent disk space issues
- The scripts are designed to be silent on success and only log errors

## Files Installed

After installation, the following files are installed:

- `/usr/local/bin/capture-shutdown` - Shutdown capture script
- `/usr/local/bin/capture-boot` - Boot capture script
- `/etc/systemd/system/capture-shutdown.service` - Systemd service for shutdown capture
- `/etc/systemd/system/capture-boot.service` - Systemd service for boot capture
- `/var/log/shutdown-traces/` - Directory for storing captured traces
