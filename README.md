## Installation

Add the patchtools directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/patchtools
```

## Usage

Most scripts provide help when invoked with `-h` or `--help`:

```bash
gort -h
mkbackportlog -h
patchreview -h
```

For menu-driven tools, simply run the script name to enter
interactive mode:

```bash
gort
patchreview
mkbackportlog
```

## Documentation Convention

Scripts in this repository use a standardized documentation format:

### Script-Level Documentation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# scriptname - Brief description of the script
#
# Longer description and usage information...
#
# Usage:
#   scriptname [options] arguments
```

### Function-Level Documentation (shdoc format)

```bash
# @description Brief description of what the function does
# @arg $1 string Description of first argument
# @arg $2 int Description of second argument
# @set varname type Description of global variable modified
# @stdout Description of output
# @exitcode 0 Success
# @exitcode 1 Error condition
funcname() {
    # function body
    return 0
}
```

### Viewing Documentation

Use `docscript` to view documentation:

```bash
docscript scriptname           # List functions (concise)
docscript -s scriptname        # Include script description
docscript -v scriptname        # Full documentation (verbose)
docscript -f funcname script   # Show specific function
```
